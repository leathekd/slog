# slog

A Clojure library designed to create log messages as Clojure maps and
log them to a file or ElasticSearch for later processing and
inspection. It adds the concept of a "context" to the log messages in
an attempt to group messages for the same logical unit of work.

It is currently incomplete and really just in the thinking-out-loud
stage.  More to come if it pans out.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[slog.core :as slog])

;; call new-context when starting a new unit of work
;; all log messages will have a :context key with a UUID making it
;; easier to group log output for logical units of work
(slog/new-context)

(slog/debug "something")
```

Look at resources/config.clj for the current config and use Carica to
set your own config for Slog.

test/log4j.properties offers a test appender for the Slog output so
that the Slog logs go to slog.log rather than littering the normal
log.

## Future

- Better docs.
- Look into performance impact.  While I may never recommend this for
  use in a tight loop, it'd be nice if it wasn't horrifically expensive.
- Queuing up the log messages in memory and flushing them all when the
  current "context" is marked as done.  Perhaps making is such that
  successful completion won't Slog anything.

  This makes a lot more sense for ES than for file based logging.
